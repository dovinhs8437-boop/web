# CoolWHIPHighlights

This is a webapp querying the database that I created in the MLB Highlights repository. https://github.com/nicktaylorstl/MLB_Highlights

The main feature is the highlights by fantasy team, which lets each team owner automatically see all the highlights for the players on his fantasy team.
There is also a feature to see all the highlights from a specific MLB team from a specific date.
You can also search for highlights of a specific player for a range of dates, or view all the highlights from a specific date.
